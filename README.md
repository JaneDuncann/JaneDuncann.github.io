[Lab 2: Working with git](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-lab2)
- This lab provided practice with adding a file to the repo, changing it, and committing the changes.  
[Lab 3: Arrow functions and object destructuring](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-lab3)
- This lab used implicit and explicit returns and worked on destructuring objects.  
[Lab 4: Fastify](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-lab4)
- This lab worked on the intersection of github and fastify to handle URLs.  
[Lab 5: Using Postman to handle HTTP verbs](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-lab5)
- This lab handled both GET and POST verbs and used Postman to visualize.  
[Lab 6: Working with classes](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-lab6)
- This lab focused on creating classes and methods.  
[Lab 7: Creating Github repositories](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-lab7)
- This lab focused creating a repository, error handling and cloning repositories.  
[Lab 8: Using the node-fetch package](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-lab8)
- This lab covered node-fetch which includes using .then() and .catch() to handle the GET HTTP verb.  
[Lab 9: Creating a release based workflow](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-lab9)
- This lab improved skills using Github and beta release.  

## CIT 281 Projects
[Project 1: Using Node.js](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-p1)
- This project focused on creating a function to return a string of a random length and used Node.js to run the program
[Project 2: Function Expressions](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-p2)
- This project used VSCode to stage, commit, and ignore files. also wrote function to sort a string
[Project 3: Creating a code module and updating the server using Fastify](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-p3)
- This project implimented a function that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. Then, the server code updates to be a Node.js web server and is handled by Fastify.
[Project 4: REST API](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-p4)
- This project required the creation of a REST API that works with a data set of questions and answers. Additionally, it used Node,js to handle the GET verb.
[Project 5: Monster Game](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-p5)
- In this project, I created a Monster game using classes.
[Project 6: Classes and Methods](https://github.com/janeduncann/cit281-p6)
